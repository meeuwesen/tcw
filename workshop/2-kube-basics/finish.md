Congrats!! You've master the second level of containerized apps building. 

Note that via [kubectl-in-action](http://mhausenblas.info/kubectl-in-action/) you can learn even more Kubernetes CLI tricks and gather tips around debugging, RBAC, etc.

OK, so you're a container Jedi Master now, but you have no seat on the council, yet. So if you wanna hang with Yoda and the gang, you can now continue with the next scenario where we'll have a look at how to use an enterprise Kubernetes distribution (OpenShift) to manage containerized apps.
