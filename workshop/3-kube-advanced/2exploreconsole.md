While the OpenShift CLI is awesome, we will create the project via the Web console. To begin, click on the **Dashboard** tab in the console frame of this browser window. This will open the web console link in another tab or window of your browser.

You should see an **OpenShift Origin** window with **Username** and **Password** forms. Enter the following:

**Username:** ``developer``{{copy}}

**Password:** ``developer``{{copy}}

After logging in to the web console, you'll see a button labeled "Create Project". 

Fill in the _Name_ field as ``dok-stock``{{copy}}. The other fields are optional and up to you. After your project is created click on the project on the right-hand side list and you should get to a screen that says "Get started with your project." Well done!
