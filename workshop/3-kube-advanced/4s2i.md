In this step you'll learn how to deploy an application direct from source code hosted in a remote Git repository using the [Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) tool.

We'll start this exercise in the Terminal but will use the Web console later as well. So let's get going:

`oc new-app https://github.com/kubernauts/dok-example-us --name=stock-con --context-dir=stock-con --strategy=source`{{execute}}

You should see the build kicked off and you can use `oc status` to check in on it.

Now we switch gears and add in the Web console the following two env vars for the `stock-con` app (switch to Web console and click on the deployment, then on the "Environment" tab)

- `DOK_STOCKGEN_HOSTNAME` with a value of `stock-gen`, and
- `DOK_STOCKGEN_PORT` with a value of `9999`

Now hit the "Save" button and a new deployment is running with your env variables set; these env variables are effectively the wiring between the consumer and the generator we deployed earlier using the Docker image strategy.

Next we need to fix the service `stock-con` service (find it in the Web console, it's under the "Applications" menu item on the lef-hand side). Select the "Actions" button in the right-upper corner and select the  "Edit YAML" option. Now change the "ports" field to the following:

```
 ...
 ports:
    - name: http
      port: 9898
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9898
```

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this lab. More information about S2I can be found in the [OpenShift S2I documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/s2i.html) and the [GitHub project respository for S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image).
