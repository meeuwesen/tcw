# Exercise: Deploying your first Image

The simplest way to deploy an application in OpenShift is to take an existing Docker-formatted image and run it. We are going to use the OpenShift web console to do this, so ensure you have the OpenShift web console open and that you are in the project called ``myproject``.

The OpenShift web console provides various options to deploy an application to a project. For this lab we are going to use the *Deploy Image* method. As the project is empty at this point, the *Overview* page should display a prominent *Add to Project* button.

Selecting the *Add to Project* button you should be presented with the options of *Browse Catalog*, *Deploy Image* and *Import YAML/JSON*. Choose the *Deploy Image* tab.
